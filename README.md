## Requirements Definition

### Overview

"The Infinity Quiz" is a project aimed at creating a quiz website where the theme is defined by the user and then generated by AI using the OpenAI API. The quizzes thus generated are then saved and made available to all users on a dedicated page.

A quiz will have a theme, a difficulty, and will initially consist of 10 questions and 4 associated answers. The 10 questions will be displayed one by one, and a result will be shown at the end summarizing all the questions and indicating the correct answers to each.

### Needs Definition

Our initial thought was oriented towards education because after our daily classes, we wanted to engage in a fun yet informative way about the topics studied. What better way than a good quiz to practice?

The issue is that writing quizzes is quite time-consuming and energy-intensive. This is where AI comes in, making the development of questions and answers quick and interesting.

Beyond that, the quiz can also be used for entertainment, as the choice of topic is specific to the user. A user wishing to generate something serious will request a serious theme, whereas a topic more oriented towards entertainment, such as "carrots," for example, will also be considered.

We aim to meet the demand for personalized quizzes by generating them through artificial intelligence, automating the process, and applying the necessary restrictions to obtain reliable results in line with the user's initial request.

### Application Structure

![alt text](Sitemap.png)

A regular visitor can access the homepage, where there are links to login/create an account and access the "quiz" page featuring the site's top 5 quizzes. They can click on a quiz to take it.

A logged-in user can also access the page listing all quizzes. They also have access to their account management page to modify their pseudonym, password, or profile picture. They can access the quiz generation page, where they can enter a theme they're interested in. When they click "generate the quiz," they must wait for the quiz to be proposed to them (generation and verification delay of OpenAI's response). Once the quiz is generated, they can take it, and upon completion, they have a page summarizing their questions/answers. If they like the quiz, they can choose to save it. If they save it, the quiz is made available on the page listing all existing quizzes. Otherwise, the quiz is deleted. If they take quizzes already generated, they can give a positive or negative vote on them the first time they take the quiz.

On the quiz referencing page, there is the possibility to sort by quizzes already taken, not taken, or to perform an exact search by theme.

Regarding the admin page, it will be possible to manage users to delete their account, manage quizzes to modify / delete them, and manage "banwords" which allow for initial validation when writing the theme by the user.
